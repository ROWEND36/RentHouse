        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Top Rated Programming Languages <span style="color:rgb(245, 20, 20); font-size: small; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">By Full Stack Academy</span></h1>
        <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
            If you’re new to the field of software development,
             the toughest part of learning programming is deciding where to begin.
              There are hundreds of programming languages in widespread use, each with its own complexities and idiosyncrasies.

The good news is that as you begin your journey as a software developer,
 you’ll start to discover which programming language will be most suitable for you, your interests, and your career goals.

In the list below, we go over the best and most in-demand programming languages 
for many of the most common use cases including web development, mobile development, game development, and more.
</p>

<h3>1. JavaScript</h3>

<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">It’s impossible to be a software developer these days without using JavaScript in some way. 
According to Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most popular language among developers
 for the eighth year in a row. Nearly 70 percent of survey respondents reported that they had used JavaScript in the past year.

Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is essential to front-end web development. 
A majority of the web’s most popular sites, from Facebook and Twitter to Gmail and YouTube, 
rely on JavaScript to create interactive web pages and dynamically display content to users.

Although JavaScript is primarily a front-end language run on the browser, 
it can also be used on the server-side through Node.js to build scalable network applications. 
Node.js is compatible with Linux, SunOS, Mac OS X, and Windows.

Because JavaScript has a forgiving, flexible syntax and works across all major browsers, 
it is one of the friendliest programming languages for beginners.

In the video below, learn why we chose to focus our curriculum on Javascript back in 2012 
and why our founders continue to stick with the programming language for 2021 and beyond.

<h3>2. Swift</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    If you’re interested in Apple products and mobile app development, Swift is a good place to start. 
    First announced by Apple in 2014, Swift is a relatively new programming language used to develop iOS and macOS applications.

Swift has been optimized for performance and built from the ground up to match the realities of modern iOS development.
 Not only does iOS run on every iPhone and iPad, but it’s also the basis for other operating systems such as watchOS (for Apple Watches)
  and tvOS (for Apple TVs). In addition,
 Apple isn't going anywhere as a tech industry leader, and iOS apps continue to be the most profitable in the mobile app marketplace.

<h3>3. Scala</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    If you’re familiar with Java—a classic programming language in its own right—it’s worth checking out its modern cousin, Scala. 
    Scala combines the best features of Java (such as its Object-Oriented Structure and its lightning-fast JVM runtime environment)
     with a modern twist.

As a functional programming language, Scala allows engineers to elevate the quality of their code to resemble pure math.
 Scala allows for concurrent programming, allowing complex procedures to be executed in parallel.
  Furthermore, it is a strongly typed language. Engineers can create and customize their own data types,
   allowing them to have the peace of mind knowing entire swaths of bugs are impossible at runtime.

<h3>4. Go</h3>

<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    One of the core languages favored by Google, Go is the little language that could.
     As a low-level language, Go is ideal for engineers who want to enter the field of systems programming.
      It encompasses much of the same functionality of C and C++ without the difficult syntax and steep learning curve.
       It’s the perfect language for building web servers, data pipelines, and even machine-learning packages.

As a compiled language, Go runs “close to the metal,” 
allowing for a blazing-fast runtime. It’s an open-source language, 
and ambitious developers can see their personal contributions adopted and enjoyed by programmers worldwide.

</p>

<h3>5. Python</h3>

<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    Python is perhaps the most user-friendly programming language of any on this list. 
    It’s often said that Python’s syntax is clear, intuitive, and almost English-like, which, like Java, makes it a popular choice for beginners.

Also like Java, Python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile, powerful option when choosing 
the best programming language for your use case. If you’re interested in back-end web development, for example, 
then the open-source Django framework, written in Python, is popular, easy to learn, and feature-rich.
 Django has been used in the development of some popular sites like Mozilla, Instagram, and Spotify.

Python also has packages such as NumPy and SciPy that are commonly used in the fields of scientific computing,
 mathematics, and engineering. Other Python libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, 
 and OpenCV are used to build programs in data science, machine learning, image processing, and computer vision. 
 Python's science and data applications make it a great choice for the academically inclined.

<h3>6. Elm</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    One of the youngest languages on our list, what began as a Harvard student’s thesis has now grown to become a point of passion
     for front-end developers around the world.

Elm compiles to JavaScript, making it ideal for building fast-executing UIs with zero errors at runtime.
 Elm is a functional programming language, allowing developers to create client-side interfaces without the declarative trappings of HTML and CSS.

Furthermore, the Elm web architecture was the intellectual inspiration for Redux, the state-management library taught here at Fullstack.

<h3>7. Ruby</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    Ruby is another scripting language that’s commonly used for web development. 
    In particular, it’s used as the basis for the popular Ruby on Rails web application framework.

Beginners often gravitate toward Ruby because it has a reputation for having one of the friendliest and most helpful user communities.
 The Ruby community even has an unofficial saying, “Matz is nice and so we are nice,” 
 encouraging members to model their kind and considerate behavior on Ruby’s chief inventor Yukihiro Matsumoto.

In addition to the active community and its straightforward syntax,
 Ruby is also a good language to pick up thanks to its association with great tech businesses.
  Twitter, Airbnb, Bloomberg, Shopify, and countless other startups have all built their websites using Ruby on Rails at some point.

<h3>8. C#</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    Like C++, C# (pronounced C Sharp) is a general-purpose, object-oriented language built on the foundations of C. 
    It was originally designed by Microsoft as part of its .NET framework for building Windows applications.

C# uses a syntax that’s similar to other C-derived languages such as C++, 
so it’s easy to pick up if you’re coming from another language in the C family.
 C# is not only the go-to for Microsoft app development, but it’s also the language mobile developers use to build 
 cross-platform apps on the Xamarin platform.

Additionally, anyone who is interested in VR development should consider learning C#. 
C# is the recommended language for building 3D and 2D video games using the popular Unity game engine,
 which produces one-third of the top games on the market.

<h3>9. Rust</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; line-height:50px;">
    Rust is a bit of an upstart among the other languages on this list, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a valuable language to learn.
     Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey found that Rust was the most loved programming language among developers for the fifth year
      in a row, with 86.1 percent of Rust developers saying that they want to continue working with it.

Developed by the Mozilla Corporation, Rust, like C and C++, is intended primarily for low-level systems programming.
 What Rust adds to the mix, however, is an emphasis on speed and security. 
 Rust emphasizes writing “safe code” by preventing programs from accessing parts of memory that they shouldn’t, 
 which can cause unexpected behavior and system crashes.

The advantages of Rust mean that other big tech companies, such as Dropbox and Coursera, are already starting to use it internally. 
While it may be a bit more difficult to master than other beginner languages, Rust programming skills are likely to pay off handsomely,
 as the language's popularity will only continue to rise in the near future.
